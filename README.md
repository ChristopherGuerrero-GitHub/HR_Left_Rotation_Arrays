# HR_Left_Rotation_Arrays
Initialize project HR - Left Rotation Array

This program is a solution for Hacker Rank problem Left Rotation Arrays.

Given an array of n integers and a number ,d, perform d left rotations on the
array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values
of (the number of integers) and (the number of left rotations you must perform).

The second line contains space-separated integers describing the respective elements
of the array's initial state.
